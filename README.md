# FoodPedia : Your Best Recipes üçí

A food recipe landing page built using React.js and API from themealdb.com would be an interactive website that allows users to search for and view a variety of meal recipes. The landing page would feature a search bar where users can enter keywords to find specific recipes or browse through a variety of categories, such as appetizers, entrees, and desserts. üç§

The page would display a list of matching recipes with images, names, and brief descriptions. Users could click on a recipe to view more detailed information, including ingredients, preparation instructions, and nutritional information. The landing page would also provide options for users to save their favorite recipes, share them on social media, or print them out. üçñ

Overall, a food recipe landing page built using React.js and API from themealdb.com would provide users with a convenient and user-friendly platform for exploring and discovering new meal ideas. üçï
